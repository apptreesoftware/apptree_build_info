# What's New in 2026.2.1

## Dark Mode Support

We've added full dark mode support to AppTree! The app now automatically matches your device's appearance settings, making it easier on your eyes in low-light conditions. Whether you prefer a bright, light interface or a sleek dark theme, AppTree adapts to your preference.

## Customize Your Theme

You're in control of how AppTree looks. Visit your profile and tap on **Theme** to choose between:

- **System Default** – Automatically follows your device's light or dark setting
- **Light** – Always use the bright, light theme
- **Dark** – Always use the dark theme

Your preference is saved to your device, so the app remembers your choice every time you open it.
